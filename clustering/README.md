# Unsupervised Learning
## Project: Identifying Customer Segments

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

I recommend you install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project. 


### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the current project directory `Udacity_ML_Projects/clustering` (that is the parent directory of this README) and run following commands.

```bash
ipython notebook identify_customer_segments.ipynb
```  
or
```bash
jupyter notebook identify_customer_segments.ipynb
```

This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.

### Data

The data contains three sets of proprietary data from AZ Direct and Arvato Finance Solution. It concerns a company that performs
mail-order sales in Germany. One dataset contains population data of demographic features, another with the same features
and for their customers only, and final one is the feature summary set. Their main question of interest is to identify 
facets of the population that are most likely to be purchasers of their products for a mailout campaign.
