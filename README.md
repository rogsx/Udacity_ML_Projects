# Udacity_ML_Projects
Three projects from Udacity ML Course. They covers supervised learning, deep learning and unsupervised learning respectively. 

In the charity donor project (supervised learning), I used GradientBoosting, Support Vector Classifier, and K-Nearest Neighbor to predict whether a charity's potential donors' income will be over $50,000 per annum. The Jupyter notebook contains initial analysis, data preprocessing, feature extraction and selection, model training, tuning and evaluation. 

The second project is a deep learning project that aimed to classify flowers using images. Pytorch is the tool of choice. 

Detailed descriptions of the projects can be found in the READMEs in each individual project folder.
